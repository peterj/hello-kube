This cheatsheet contains a list of most common commands you will use when working with Kubernetes cluster and its resources.

If you're working with Kubernetes on daily basis or if you're just learning about Kubernetes you will run into a set of commands that are used often than the other commands. The ones used more often are also usually easy to remember (especially if you're typing them out multiple times a day).

The problem becomes when you're either trying to do something more advanced or run a command against a resource you're aren't using very often or not too familiar with it. This is where this cheatsheet comes into play - it will help you quickly find the command you want, so you can copy & paste it, run it and move on.

You can bookmark this page and return to it any time you're feeling stuck.

# How to use this kubectl Cheatsheet

Welcome to the **kubectl cheatsheet**. This cheatsheet is organized into multiple sections that are based on the actions you are trying to perform against Kubernetes resources. Each section contains a table with the command and the explanation of what that command does.

## Introduction

Welcome friends! I am glad you've decided to either learn more about `kubectl` or just trying to find some useful commands or ideas. First things first - since you're here, I am assuming you have a Kubernetes cluster running and have access to it and you also have `kubectl` installed.

## The basics

The commands in this cheatsheet are all using the full name of the Kubernetes CLI - `kubectl`. If you'll be working with Kubernetes often, I strongly advise you to create an alias for that command - it will save you a lot of typing in the long run. If you want to take this to another level, [check out this set of Kubectl aliases](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectl-aliases).

To create an alias for `kubectl`, you can run the following command:

```bash
alias k='kubectl'
```

Or just put it directly in your `~/.bash_profile` file:

```bash
echo "alias k='kubectl'" >> ~/.bash_profile
```

In most of the example below, I am using a pod resource as an example - you can replace pod with any other Kubernetes resource (unless the commnd is specific to that one reasource only).

I am also using the full resource names such as `pod`, `deployment` etc. but you don't have to. Refer to the [Resource names](#resource-names) section for short resource names such as `po`, `svc` or `deploy`.

Let's get started!

## Basic resource information

| Command                                    | Explanation                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kubectl get pod mypod`                    | Lists the pod with name `mypod` in the current namespace              |

| `kubectl get pod -n mynamespace`           | Lists all pods in `mynamespace` namespace                             |
| `kubectl get pod --all-namespaces`         | Lists all pods in all namespaces                                      |

| `kubectl get all --all-namespaces`         | Lists all resources in the cluster                                    |
| `kubectl describe pod mypod`               | Describes the resource in mor details (perfect for diagnosing issues) |
| `kubectl get pod --show-labels`            | Shows the labels next to all pods                                     |
| `kubectl explain pod`                      | Shows documentation for the resource (e.g. `pod` in our case)         |
| `kubectl get pod mypod -o yaml`            | Shows the YAML representation of the pod called `mypod`               |
| `kubectl get pod mypod -o json`            | Shows the JSON representation of the pod called `mypod`               |
| `kubectl cluster-info`                     | Shows information about the cluster                                   |
| `kubectl describe`                         | Lists all resource names                                              |
| `kubectl get pod -w`                       | Watches the pods (useful when waiting for e.g. pods to start)         |

> Note 1: replace the `pod` in above commands with any other resource (e.g. `service`, `deployment`, ...)

> Note 2: use the short name for resources. For example: `po` for `pods`, `svc` for `service`, `deploy` for `deployment`, etc.
